# Sensor Covariance

- To Find the R value for each sensor in the Kalman filter code, the covariance of each sensor is calculated.
- Data from the sensor is collected in [data.csv](https://github.com/ShriramUmashankar/ProjectAbhyuday/blob/main/SensorCovariance/data.csv) and the Matlab code [SensorCovariance.m](hyperlink) was used to calculate the covariance of the sensors.
- R value for accelerometer is 0.0029.
- R value for height (BME) is 2.0602.
